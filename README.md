## Description:

This project is based on html and css technology to build and design a website that will display "Hello Microverse!" which had the developer's favorite color for the text. The project was implemented with linters which make sure that some specific features are implemented successfully on the project for best user experience.

The purpose of the project is to create a website that has the best user experience. The html document has an header that displays "Hello Microverse!" while the css file which is the style document for the project has a styling color that beautify the html document's header. The linters in this project includes:
"lighthouse" which help to improve the quality of webpage,
"webhint" is a customizable linting tool that helps you improve your site's accessibility, speed, cross-browser compatibility, and more by checking your code for best practices and common errors and
"Stylelint" which helps you avoid errors and enforce conventions in your styles.
The goal here is to master all of the tools and best practices because they will be used more often throughout Microverse projects and most likely in future job as well.
